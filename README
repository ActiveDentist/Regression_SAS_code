###_Regression Course at CSU East Bay_

This is my SAS code from the regression course I took in graduate school. Included is code I wrote for the homework assignments, a group project, and the final exam. I will be updating this repository with the instructions for all of these assignments very soon. 

All of the homework assignments, the group project, and the final exam were implemented in SAS, as the entire course was taught using SAS.

This course covered the following topics:  
* Simple Linear Regression  
* Inferences in Regression and Correlation Analysis  
* Diagnostics and Remedial Measures  
* Matrix Approaches to Regression  
* Multiple Linear Regression  
* Polynomial Regression Models  
* Qualitative and Indicator (Dummy) Variables  
* Variable Interactions  
* Model-Building  
* Model Selection  
* Model Validation  
* Programming in SAS  
* Multicollinearity  
* Outlier Analysis
